<h2><strong>Marketing Campaign for the website:</strong></h2>
<p>Only 1.5 % of Indian population invests in the stock market, they are clearly suspicious of alternate investments. So for a product like finance-peer trust and consequently maintaining an accessible image is very important.</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The current website shows a viable financial instrument, and it does that job well, but it will appeal primarily to investors.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Majority of the public sticks to savings accounts and F.D.s out of the distrust for, and inexperience with, financial-institutions. But loans are a house-hold need and a much wider targeted marketing campaighn is possible:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Instead of presenting ourselves like a financial tool. we present a community of borrowers and lenders that will not let banks give them a bad deal and will replace them with advanced AI as the middle-man.</div>

<div>We want people who come across our service to let others know about it. Presenting ourself as a cause and idea makes us more appropriate for conversation.</div>
