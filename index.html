<h2>background :</h2>
<p>Projecting this service just as a sound financial choice will get us the attention of investors but in a country where only 1.5% of the population invests, that's very few people. A majority of the public sticks to savings accounts and F.D.s out of the distrust for and inexperience with financial institutions.</p>
<p>But loans are a household need and borrowers should be the prime target because investors value borrower involvement not vice-versa.</p>
<h2>my suggestions:</h2>
<p>1) We are not a good financial service from an exciting fintech startup. No.<br />We want to change the world for the better. We want to stop banks from exploiting people and want to outsmart them. Our community is dedicated to paving a shorter way and creating a new future.</p>
<p>2) This cause really resonates with most people. It gets people talking. It gives people a reason to leave the comfort of the bank. Most importantly it will give as a more involved and loyal user base.<br />Despite seeming like a risky move it is basically an attempt to give our USP a story.</p>
<p>3) Maintain a simple but consistent aesthetic that promises uber-era convenience and transparency,&nbsp;</p>
